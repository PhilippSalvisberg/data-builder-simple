# data-builder-simple
A demo of the builder pattern for test data creation in PLSQL

There are two sources for the idea behind this implementation:

1. The book Working Effectively with Unit Tests, by Jay Fields
2. Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests, by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce

Plus blog posts by Steve Freeman on the same subject.
